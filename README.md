# Car Price Prediction Dashboard

This project aims to develop an Adaptive Buisness Intelligence Solution using Machine learning techniques to predict the prices of used Toyota cars. By leveraging a Random Forest regression model, the solution provides accurate price predictions based on car model, year, and mileage. The project also includes an interactive dashboard for users to input car details and receive price predictions, along with a summary of the car model inventory inventory.
